The quote was from Dr. Susan Friedman and it says.\n\n\n\n\"The key question is not, how do I stop this problem behaviour? Rather, the question is, what do I want the animal to do instead, then teach it.\"\n\n\n\nIt's a good quote with plenty of merit.  There are many who have taken it and have inferred that in order to do this justice, it can only be by way of teaching incompatible behaviours so the dog cannot perform the old behaviour.\n\n\n\nWe feel that incompatible behaviour is certainly a consideration, however it's limiting by not addressing punishment.\n\n\n\nIn this episode we discussed the ramifications of just this.\n\n\n\nFurther details\n\n\n\nlooking for great dog trainers and supporters of the canine paradigm?

According to Pat, it was of epic proportions and it gave him some perspective on how his dog must feel when he is confused about a situation and doesn't have the ability to effectively communicate it.\n\n\n\nAny good educator will always consider the teachable moment, even in an unfavourable moment.  Even a child's tantrum, which most parents would prefer to not have to go through can be an insight into language, behaviour or control.\n\n\n\nFor us, it was a way of taking a child tantrum and swinging back into a relative topic about training dogs.\n\n\n\nperhaps this a good line for an episode from the past talking about how to deal with pressure\n\n\n\nFurther details\n\n\n\nlooking for great dog trainers and supporters of the canine paradigm?

However, they may need to be the point of focus themselves as they can be hate filled, agenda driven, divisive nut cases with intentions of destruction over building community or developing culture.\n\n\n\nIt's reassuring to know that this is the small minority and not the wonderful, supportive majority of our canine community that we have come to know and love.\n\n\n\nAfter you listen to this episode, there's plenty more like this one\n\n\n\nFurther details\n\n\n\nlooking for great dog trainers and supporters of the canine paradigm?

Did they have intuition or were they in turn mentored?\n\n\n\nCheck out some of the earlier episode we have done on similar topics, episode 161 and episode 117\n\n\n\nFurther details\n\n\n\nlooking for great dog trainers and supporters of the canine paradigm?

2022 22:07:28 -0400", "summary": "Setting a dangerous precedent is focussing on how a state Government decided it would announce the banning of certain training tools.\n\n\n\nThe concern here once again, is the complete lack of industry consultation along the way with industry experts or any of the thousands of people who use these tools with enormous benefits.\n\n\n\nWe are joined by Kirsty Reid as she and Brittany Young with assistance from Marcia Davies, have created a on-line petition to demand better representation and consideration from Government decision makers.\n\n\n\nWhat is a precedent you may ask? An earlier event or action that is regarded as an example or guide to be considered in subsequent similar circumstances.\n\n\n\nSo you may not entirely support some of the training tools that are being considered on the banning list but again the precedence from this action will leech into other areas that will have an effect on something you do want or need.\n\n\n\nYou can email the ladies direct on dogtrainingqld@gmail.com to receive all the information you require on how to help support this cause.\n\n\n\nFurther details\n\n\n\nlooking for great dog trainers and supporters of the canine paradigm?
